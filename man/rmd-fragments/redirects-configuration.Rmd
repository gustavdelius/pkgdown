If you change the structure of your documentation (by renaming vignettes or help topics) you can setup redirects from the old content to the new content.
One or several now-absent pages can be redirected to a new page (or to a new section of a new page.

```yaml
redirects:
  articles/new-vignette-name.html:
  - articles/old-vignette-name.html
  - articles/another-old-vignette-name.html
  articles/new-vignette-name.html#section:
  - articles/yet-another-old-vignette-name.html
```
